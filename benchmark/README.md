To benchmark and compare the output from three different tools (TransPhylo, outbreaker2, and transcluster). The idea is to get a common output format that can then be used to compare the three methods.

1. pairs_to_cluster.R takes TransPhylo output in pairwise form (e.g. transphylo_demo_output.tsv) and outputs cluster assignments alongside each sample.
2. outbreaker_to_clusters.R takes outbreaker2 output in pairwise form (e.g. outbreaker2_demo_output.csv) and outputs cluster assignments alongside each sample.
